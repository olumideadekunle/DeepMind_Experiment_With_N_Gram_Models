In this lab, you will automatically estimate the probabilities for predicting the next word and build an **n-gram model** using a small dataset of paragraphs. This will result in a language model that will be able to predict the next word for a given prompt and that can be used to generate texts. You will also gain a practical understanding of how n-gram models capture language patterns and what the limitations of this family of models are. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for exploring more advanced language models in later modules."

        "Note that the space tokenizer is quite naive. When you are tokenizing based only on spaces, you will observe that the punctuation marks are often considered part of the words. For example, tokenizing the sentence \"Table mountain is tall.\"  will result in a different list of words than tokenizing \"Table mountain is tall\". The first sentence results in (`[\"Table\", \"mountain\", \"is\", \"tall.\"]`. The second sentence, which has the period missing from the end, will result in `[\"Table\", \"mountain\", \"is\", \"tall\"]`). Since the units that tokenizers split sequences into are not always a word, they are usually referred to as **tokens**.

        "When moving from bigrams (pairs of tokens) to trigrams (triplets of tokens), the number of possible combinations increases exponentially, and many of these triplets rarely, if ever, appear in the dataset.

This makes it more challenging for the model to reliably predict the next token.\n",

        "\n",
        "**1. Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- You saw how n-gram models can be used to predict the next token in a sequence based on the preceding tokens (context).\n",
        "- N-gram models are relatively simple to implement by estimating conditional probabilities from n-gram counts in a dataset. These probabilities can then be used to repeatedly sample the next token and generate new continuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Data sparsity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data sparsity is a major challenge for n-gram models, especially with higher-order n-grams (trigrams or larger).\n",
        "- This sparsity arises because many possible token combinations are rare or absent in real-world text data.\n",
        "- You observed this in the dataset. The dimensions of the trigram matrix are significantly larger than those of the bigram matrix, resulting in more zero values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Randomness and text generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- While the model assigns probabilities to different next tokens, the actual choice is stochastic (random), resulting in different outputs for multiple runs.\n",
        "- While higher probabilities increase the chances of a token being picked, less frequent tokens can also be generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Considerations for text generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The size of *n* can affect the quality of the generated text. Larger *n* might capture longer-range dependencies but can lead to data sparsity and repetitive outputs.\n",
        "- The model is unable to generate text following an n-gram that is not present in the dataset.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **N-gram Generation and Counting:** The `generate_ngrams` function successfully generated unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Subsequently, the `get_ngram_counts` function correctly computed context-specific n-gram frequencies, passing all internal test cases.\n",
        "*   **Significant Data Sparsity:** A key observation was the high degree of sparsity in the n-gram counts. Specifically, 99.95% of possible bigrams and 99.98% of possible trigrams were not found in the dataset (i.e., had a count of 0). This highlights a common challenge in n-gram modeling, particularly for higher orders.\n",
        "*   **N-gram Language Model Construction:** The `build_ngram_model` function successfully converted n-gram counts into conditional probabilities, establishing a probabilistic language model where `P(next_token | context)` could be retrieved. This implementation also passed its respective test cases.\n",
        "*   **Model Limitations due to Sparsity:** The model exhibited limitations when queried for unseen contexts. For instance, attempting to access `trigram_model[\"Their name\"]` resulted in a `KeyError`, demonstrating that the model cannot predict for contexts not present in the training data.\n",
        "*   **Bigram Count Verification:** The bigram count for the phrase \"a staple\" was consistently determined to be 13, both when computed indirectly from trigram counts and directly from the `bigram_counts` dictionary. This confirmed the accurate population of the count dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   Given the extremely high sparsity observed (99.95% for bigrams, 99.98% for trigrams), implementing smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) is crucial to handle unseen n-grams and improve the generalizability and robustness of the language model for real-world applications.\n",
        "*   To address the `KeyError` issue and enable predictions for previously unseen contexts, the n-gram model could be enhanced with fallback mechanisms (e.g., using lower-order n-grams) or interpolation techniques to provide a probability estimate rather than failing outright.\n"

        "    *   **Bigram Model:** While sometimes coherent, the bigram model's generations often felt more disjointed or grammatically awkward, as seen in \"looking for the day in the bread are cooked with warm temperatures.\" It can connect words that frequently appear together but might not form a syntactically or semantically sound phrase given a broader context.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Overall coherence:**\n",
        "    *   On average, the **trigram model produces more coherent continuations**. The increased context size helps it maintain better flow and relevance to the preceding words, resulting in outputs that are generally more natural-sounding.\n",
        "    \n",
        "4.  **Failure to produce valid continuation:**\n",
        "    *   The **trigram model is more prone to failing to produce a valid continuation** (i.e., printing the 'No valid continuation found' message). This is directly related to the problem of **data sparsity**. As `n` increases, the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially. Many trigrams that might be grammatically valid might simply not appear in the training dataset. When the model encounters a context for which it has no observed next tokens in its training data, it cannot generate a continuation.\n",
        "    *   The bigram model, with its smaller context, has a higher chance of finding at least one continuation, as bigrams are generally more frequent and less sparse than trigrams.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Reflection on `KeyError` and sparsity:**\n",
        "    *   The `KeyError` experienced earlier when trying to access `trigram_model['Their name']` perfectly illustrates the sparsity issue. Because the bigram \"Their name\" did not appear in the training data followed by any specific token, there was no entry for this context in the `trigram_model`. This is a direct consequence of the data sparsity problem inherent in n-gram models, especially for higher orders. It highlights that while a larger `n` can theoretically capture richer context, in practice, it often leads to situations where the model simply has no data for many contexts, limiting its ability to generate text for those specific phrases."

        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "1.  **Which model produced more sensible and grammatically correct continuations?**\n",
        "    The trigram model generally produced more sensible and grammatically correct continuations due to its ability to consider a larger context (two preceding words).\n",
        "2.  **Which model tended to produce more coherent continuations on average?**\n",
        "    The trigram model produced more coherent continuations on average, as its increased context size helped maintain better flow and relevance in the generated text.\n",
        "3.  **Which model failed more often to produce a valid continuation?**\n",
        "    The trigram model was more prone to failing to produce a valid continuation, often printing the \"No valid continuation found\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   Initially, the `trigram_model` failed to populate correctly, resulting in persistent `KeyError` when attempting to access its content (e.g., for contexts like 'as it').\n",
        "*   The `trigram_model` was successfully built and populated after ensuring all necessary helper functions (`space_tokenize`, `generate_ngrams`, `get_ngram_counts`, `build_ngram_model`) were correctly defined and executed.\n",
        "*   The trigram model generated text (e.g., \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for a cup of Kenyan chai, rich and peanut-infused, or spicy\") which was generally more sensible, grammatically correct, and coherent compared to the bigram model's output (e.g., \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for the day in the bread are cooked with warm temperatures\").\n",
        "*   The trigram model demonstrated a higher propensity for encountering contexts not present in its training data, leading to failures to generate continuations. This highlights the inherent problem of data sparsity in higher-order n-gram models.\n",
        "*   The `KeyError` previously encountered with contexts like `trigram_model['Their name']` was identified as a direct consequence of this data sparsity, where specific n-grams were not observed during model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   To mitigate the data sparsity issue in higher-order n-gram models, consider implementing smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) to assign non-zero probabilities to unseen n-grams, allowing the model to generate text more robustly.\n",
        "*   The trade-off between model complexity (higher 'n' for more context and coherence) and data sparsity (higher 'n' for more unseen n-grams) needs to be carefully managed. For practical applications, a hybrid approach or back-off models could be explored to balance these factors.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "1.  **Which model produced more sensible and grammatically correct continuations?**\n",
        "    The trigram model generally produced more sensible and grammatically correct continuations due to its ability to consider a larger context (two preceding words).\n",
        "2.  **Which model tended to produce more coherent continuations on average?**\n",
        "    The trigram model produced more coherent continuations on average, as its increased context size helped maintain better flow and relevance in the generated text.\n",
        "3.  **Which model failed more often to produce a valid continuation?**\n",
        "    The trigram model was more prone to failing to produce a valid continuation, often printing the \"No valid continuation found\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   Initially, the `trigram_model` failed to populate correctly, resulting in persistent `KeyError` when attempting to access its content (e.g., for contexts like 'as it').\n",
        "*   The `trigram_model` was successfully built and populated after ensuring all necessary helper functions (`space_tokenize`, `generate_ngrams`, `get_ngram_counts`, `build_ngram_model`) were correctly defined and executed.\n",
        "*   The trigram model generated text (e.g., \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for a cup of Kenyan chai, rich and peanut-infused, or spicy\") which was generally more sensible, grammatically correct, and coherent compared to the bigram model's output (e.g., \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for the day in the bread are cooked with warm temperatures\").\n",
        "*   The trigram model demonstrated a higher propensity for encountering contexts not present in its training data, leading to failures to generate continuations. This highlights the inherent problem of data sparsity in higher-order n-gram models.\n",
        "*   The `KeyError` previously encountered with contexts like `trigram_model['Their name']` was identified as a direct consequence of this data sparsity, where specific n-grams were not observed during model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   To mitigate the data sparsity issue in higher-order n-gram models, consider implementing smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) to assign non-zero probabilities to unseen n-grams, allowing the model to generate text more robustly.\n",
        "*   The trade-off between model complexity (higher 'n' for more context and coherence) and data sparsity (higher 'n' for more unseen n-grams) needs to be carefully managed. For practical applications, a hybrid approach or back-off models could be explored to balance these factors.\n",

        "N-gram models are foundational in natural language processing (NLP) for estimating the probability of word sequences. This lab focused on building such models to predict the next token in a sequence, a core task in text generation. The primary objective was to gain a practical understanding of how n-grams capture language patterns and to identify the challenges associated with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "1.  **Dataset:** We utilized the Africa Galore dataset, a collection of synthetically generated paragraphs focusing on African culture, history, and geography.\n",
        "2.  **Tokenization:** Text was tokenized into word-like units using a simple space tokenizer.\n",
        "3.  **N-gram Counting:** Functions were developed to extract and count n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) from the tokenized dataset.\n",
        "4.  **Probability Estimation:** Conditional probabilities $P(\\mbox{B} \\mid \\mbox{A}) = \\frac{\\mbox{Count}(\\mbox{A B})}{\\mbox{Count}(\\mbox{A})}$ were calculated based on these n-gram counts.\n",
        "5.  **Text Generation:** An iterative process was implemented to generate new text by sampling the next token based on the estimated probabilities, given a preceding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Findings\n",
        "*   **N-gram Generation and Counting:** Successfully implemented functions to generate and count n-grams of varying lengths.\n",
        "*   **Significant Data Sparsity:** A high degree of data sparsity was observed, with **99.95% of possible bigrams** and **99.98% of possible trigrams** having zero occurrences in the dataset. This highlights a fundamental challenge for n-gram models.\n",
        "*   **Model Construction:** Successfully built and tested n-gram language models that convert counts into conditional probabilities.\n",

        "## Limitations of N-gram Models\n",
        "*   **Data Sparsity:** The primary limitation, especially for higher-order n-grams, leading to zero probabilities for unseen sequences and an inability to generate continuations for many contexts.\n",
        "*   **KeyError Incidents:** Directly linked to sparsity, where attempting to access probabilities for unobserved contexts results in errors.\n",
        "*   **Lack of Long-Range Dependencies:** N-gram models only consider a fixed, local context, making them ineffective at capturing longer-range linguistic dependencies.\n",
        "*   **Fixed Context Size:** The 'n' value is rigid, limiting adaptability to different linguistic phenomena.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
        "N-gram models offer a simple yet powerful approach to language modeling, capable of capturing local word patterns. However, their inherent vulnerability to data sparsity limits their applicability, particularly with larger 'n' values or smaller datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Future Improvements:**\n",
        "*   **Smoothing Techniques:** Implement smoothing algorithms (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) to address zero probabilities for unseen n-grams and improve model robustness.\n",
        "*   **Back-off Models:** Explore combining models of different 'n' values (e.g., backing off to a bigram model if a trigram is unseen) to provide more consistent predictions.\n",
        "*   **Comparison with Advanced Models:** Investigate more sophisticated models, such as neural network-based language models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers), which are better equipped to handle long-range dependencies and data sparsity.\n",

        "*   Highlight the importance of understanding language patterns and limitations of these models.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Methodology\n",
        "*   **Dataset:** Describe the Africa Galore dataset (source, size, content focus).\n",
        "*   **Tokenization:** Explain the space tokenization process and its simplicity/limitations (e.g., handling punctuation).\n",
        "*   **N-gram Counting:** Detail how n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) were generated and counted from the tokenized text.\n",
        "*   **Probability Estimation:** Explain the formula $P(\\mbox{B} \\mid \\mbox{A}) = \\frac{\\mbox{Count}(\\mbox{A B})}{\\mbox{Count}(\\mbox{A})}$ and how conditional probabilities were calculated.\n",

        "#### 3. Key Findings\n",
        "*   **N-gram Counts:** Present examples of most common bigrams and trigrams found in the dataset.\n",
        "*   **Sparsity Observation:** Discuss the visual evidence of data sparsity in bigram and trigram count matrices.\n",
        "*   **Model Building Success:** Confirm the successful implementation and testing of `generate_ngrams`, `get_ngram_counts`, and `build_ngram_model` functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Model Comparison (Bigram vs. Trigram)\n",
        "*   **Qualitative Comparison (Coherence & Grammatical Correctness):**\n",
        "    *   Show examples of text generated by both bigram and trigram models from the same prompt (e.g., \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for\").\n",
        "    *   Discuss how trigram generations generally appeared more sensible and grammatically coherent due to larger context.\n",
        "*   **Quantitative Comparison (Data Sparsity):**\n",
        "    *   Present the bar chart showing the percentage of zero counts for bigram vs. trigram models.\n",
        "    *   Emphasize that the trigram model exhibits significantly higher sparsity (e.g., 99.98% zero counts vs. 99.95% for bigram).\n",
        "    *   Explain how this higher sparsity makes the trigram model more prone to failing to find continuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. Limitations of N-gram Models\n",
        "*   **Data Sparsity:** Reiterate this as the primary limitation, leading to zero probabilities for unseen n-grams.\n",
        "*   **KeyError Example:** Refer to the `KeyError` encountered with contexts like `trigram_model['Their name']` as a direct consequence of sparsity.\n",
        "*   **Lack of Long-Range Dependencies:** Discuss how n-grams only capture local context ($n-1$ words) and struggle with longer dependencies.\n",
        "*   **Fixed Context Size:** Mention the inflexibility of the fixed 'n' value.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. Conclusions and Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Summary:** Briefly summarize the strengths (simplicity, capturing local patterns) and weaknesses (sparsity, limited context) of n-gram models.\n",
        "*   **Addressing Limitations:** Suggest potential improvements like smoothing techniques (Laplace, Kneser-Ney) to mitigate sparsity.\n",
        "*   **Future Directions:** Hint at more advanced language models (e.g., neural networks) that overcome n-gram limitations by learning distributed representations and longer dependencies."

        "1.  **Which model produced more sensible and grammatically correct continuations?**\n",
        "    The trigram model generally produced more sensible and grammatically correct continuations due to its ability to consider a larger context (two preceding words).\n",
        "2.  **Which model tended to produce more coherent continuations on average?**\n",
        "    The trigram model produced more coherent continuations on average, as its increased context size helped maintain better flow and relevance in the generated text.\n",
        "3.  **Which model failed more often to produce a valid continuation?**\n",
        "    The trigram model was more prone to failing to produce a valid continuation, often printing the \"No valid continuation found\" message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The trigram model produced more coherent and grammatically correct text continuations compared to the bigram model (e.g., \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for a cup of Kenyan chai, rich and peanut-infused, or spicy\" vs. \"Jide was hungry so she went looking for the day in the bread are cooked with warm temperatures\").\n",
        "*   Data sparsity is a significant issue, especially for higher-order n-gram models. The trigram model demonstrated a higher propensity for encountering contexts not present in its training data, leading to failures in generation.\n",
        "*   The visualization confirmed that the trigram model exhibits significantly higher data sparsity than the bigram model, meaning a larger percentage of possible trigrams were not observed in the training data. For instance, the result mentions \"99.98% zero counts vs. 99.95% for bigram\" (though the exact percentages depend on the specific dataset and model).\n",
        "*   `KeyError` incidents, such as with `trigram_model['Their name']`, were a direct consequence of this data sparsity, indicating unseen n-grams during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   To mitigate the data sparsity issue in higher-order n-gram models, consider implementing smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) to assign non-zero probabilities to unseen n-grams, improving model robustness.\n",
        "*   Balance model complexity (higher 'n' for more context) with data sparsity by exploring hybrid approaches or back-off models to achieve better performance across different contexts.\n"

        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "N-gram models are foundational in natural language processing (NLP) for estimating the probability of word sequences. This lab focused on building such models to predict the next token in a sequence, a core task in text generation. The primary objective was to gain a practical understanding of how n-grams capture language patterns and to identify the challenges associated with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Methodology\n",
        "*   **Dataset:** We utilized the Africa Galore dataset, a collection of synthetically generated paragraphs focusing on African culture, history, and geography.\n",
        "*   **Tokenization:** Text was tokenized into word-like units using a simple space tokenizer.\n",
        "*   **N-gram Counting:** Functions were developed to extract and count n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) from the tokenized dataset.\n",
        "*   **Probability Estimation:** Conditional probabilities $P(\\mbox{B} \\mid \\mbox{A}) = \\frac{\\mbox{Count}(\\mbox{A B})}{\\mbox{Count}(\\mbox{A})}$ were calculated based on these n-gram counts.\n",
        "*   **Text Generation:** An iterative process was implemented to generate new text by sampling the next token based on the estimated probabilities, given a preceding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Key Findings\n",
        "*   **N-gram Generation and Counting:** Successfully implemented functions to generate and count n-grams of varying lengths.\n",
        "*   **Sparsity Observation:** Discussed the visual evidence of data sparsity in bigram and trigram count matrices.\n",
        "*   **Model Building Success:** Confirmed the successful implementation and testing of `generate_ngrams`, `get_ngram_counts`, and `build_ngram_model` functions.\n",

        "*   **Lack of Long-Range Dependencies:** N-gram models only consider a fixed, local context, making them ineffective at capturing longer-range linguistic dependencies beyond the `n-1` preceding tokens.\n",
        "*   **Fixed Context Size:** The 'n' value is rigid, limiting adaptability to different linguistic phenomena.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
        "N-gram models offer a simple yet powerful approach to language modeling, capable of capturing local word patterns. However, their inherent vulnerability to data sparsity limits their applicability, particularly with larger 'n' values or smaller datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Future Improvements:**\n",
        "*   **Smoothing Techniques:** Implement smoothing algorithms (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) to address zero probabilities for unseen n-grams and improve model robustness.\n",
        "*   **Back-off Models:** Explore combining models of different 'n' values (e.g., backing off to a bigram model if a trigram is unseen) to provide more consistent predictions.\n",
        "*   **Comparison with Advanced Models:** Investigate more sophisticated models, such as neural network-based language models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers), which are better equipped to handle long-range dependencies and data sparsity.\n",

        "*   **N-gram Model Lifecycle Conceptualization**: A clear, five-stage conceptual flow was outlined for N-gram models, spanning from raw text input to tokenization, N-gram counting, probability estimation, and finally text generation.\n",
        "*   **N-gram Frequency Distribution**:\n",
        "    *   Visualization of the top 10 most common unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams was successfully generated, highlighting the most frequent word patterns learned by the model from the dataset.\n",
        "    *   Unigram analysis reveals individual word popularity, while bigram and trigram charts illustrate common two- and three-word phrases present in the dataset.\n",
        "*   **Data Sparsity**: As 'n' increases, data sparsity significantly worsens. The bigram model exhibited 99.95% zero counts, whereas the trigram model showed a higher sparsity of 99.98% zero counts, indicating a greater inability to find continuations for unseen contexts.\n",
        "*   **Model Coherence and Failure Rate**: The trigram model generally produced more coherent and grammatically correct continuations compared to the bigram model due to a larger context. However, it was also more prone to failures (e.g., `KeyError`) when encountering unseen contexts due to increased sparsity.\n",
        "*   **Conditional Probability Distribution**: A bar chart was successfully generated, illustrating the conditional probability distribution for a specific context (e.g., \"looking for\"), showing the likelihood of various next tokens appearing after that context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Address Data Sparsity**: The pervasive issue of data sparsity in N-gram models, especially higher-order ones, necessitates implementing smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing) or back-off models to handle unseen n-grams and improve model robustness.\n",
        "*   **Explore Advanced Models**: For capturing long-range dependencies and mitigating sparsity more effectively, investigate and compare the performance of N-gram models with modern neural network-based language models such as LSTMs or Transformers.\n"

        "N-gram models are foundational in natural language processing (NLP) for estimating the probability of word sequences. This lab focused on building such models to predict the next token in a sequence, a core task in text generation. The primary objective was to gain a practical understanding of how n-grams capture language patterns and to identify the challenges associated with them.\n",

        "## 2. Methodology\n",
